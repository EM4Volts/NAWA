Once they had fulfilled their purpose, all maintenance was stopped\u2014but they still managed to adapt to, and thrive in, their environments. As a result, current species are no longer hostile towards androids, and instead concentrate on not dying much like any other animal. In contrast to land-based machines, however, their data banks are no longer synced, so the evolution of their intelligence has pretty much ground to a halt.\n\nMany machine fish have formed symbiotic relationships with natural ones, allowing them to consume the sessile organisms on their bodies\u2014such as moss and barnacles\u2014in exchange for protection. With natural fish performing their maintenance, machine fish now live lives which are the exact opposite of what they were designed to do.\n\nIn recent years, new ecologies have been observed as a result of such symbiotic relationships. Some, for instance, have formed colonies in order to protect themselves, leading to increased aquatic life across the planet. Of course, the current ecology is quite different from when mankind still inhabited Earth, but the sheer quantity of fish is sure to be a surprise once they finally return from the moon.\n\nHowever, there are even bigger changes afoot.

    "PAUSE_ARCHIVE_180_010": "Overview\n\nWhile the machine lifeform network was destroyed following the collapse of the Tower, a great deal of previously unknown information regarding machine lifeforms and aliens was recovered from the wreckage. As part of this analysis, we compiled research and conjecture regarding both the machine lifeform network and the lifeform Codename N2\u2014commonly known as the Red Girls\u2014that was thought to have been commanding them.\n\n- Machine lifeforms are weapons created by the aliens. The only command given for their behavior was to \"defeat the enemy.\" However, it appears that their capacity for growth and evolution went too far, and they eventually turned on and killed their creators.\n\n- At this point, machine lifeforms recognized that the goal of \"defeating the enemy\" actually REQUIRED an enemy. In order to maintain this singular objective, they reached the contradictory conclusion that their current enemies\u2014the androids\u2014could not be annihilated completely, lest they no longer have an enemy to defeat.\n\n- In order to resolve this inherent contradiction, the machine lifeforms began to intentionally cause deficiencies in their network, diversifying the vectors of evolution for all machines. This is the cause behind some of the more \"special\" machine lifeforms, such as Pascal and the Forest King.\n\n- Meanwhile, the deficient network began repeating a process of self-repair while incorporating surrounding information, until it finally reached a fixed state as a new form of network. Traces of information regarding human memories from the quantum server of the old model were discovered, indicating that it had integrated them during the final stages of its growth process. Said server contained a record of the discarded \"Project Gestalt,\" as well as information on the human who was the first successful example of the Gestalt process.\n\n- Having acquired information regarding humanity, the network's structure changed once more, becoming what might better be called a meta network (or a \"concept\", to borrow the words of the machines). This led directly to the formation of the ego we identify as N2.\n\n...So then! To sum up: For hundreds of years, we've been fighting a network of machines with the ghost of humanity at its core. We've been living in a stupid fucking world where we fight an endless war that we COULDN'T POSSIBLY LOSE, all for the sake of some Council of Humanity on the moon that doesn't even exist.\n\nI don't know what the point is to all this, but I swear I will kill every evolutionary dead-end machine lifeform, as well as every single asshole behind Project YoRHa.\n\nI'm coming for all your heads.
